# Class Televisão

Here was created a class called Televisao that have as properties canal, volume and mute, and then some methods to change the channel(canal) up and down, volume up and down and to change the volume into mute(mudo) or unmute(não mudo).

## How it works?

To change the channels and volume we just need to call the proper function related to it's actions and then to print it to check the results.

## Future plans / improvements

I will try to automate the procces of changing the channel and volume by user input. And improve the quality of code.
